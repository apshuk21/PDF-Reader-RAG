# PDF Reader RAG Application

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **PDF Reader** powered by **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using **LangChain** and **OpenAI**. It follows a structured three-step process to extract insights from PDFs:
1. **Data Ingestion** – Load and preprocess PDF files.
2. **Data Retrieval** – Retrieve relevant information using embeddings.
3. **Data Generation** – Generate responses based on retrieved data using an LLM.

## 🚀 Features
- **Extract text from PDFs** and store structured embeddings.
- **Retrieve contextually relevant chunks** from the processed PDFs.
- **Generate AI-driven responses** using OpenAI’s GPT model.
- **Optimized for question-answering** workflows.
